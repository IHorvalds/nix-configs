# BASH prompt + ssh-agent

`source` the user-prompt.sh in any non-user's .bashrc for nice colours.
`source` the root-prompt.sh in /root/.bashrc for even cooler colours.

`source` ssh-agent.sh in the non-user's .bashrc to load all the private keys in ~/.ssh.
I hate having to do that manually every time I set up a new machine.
